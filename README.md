# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Notes and exercise solutions to the second edition of Sutton &amp; Barto's book.

This is all pretty scrappy now, will improve as I go on.

-----

Note: The code has been refactored as I've gone along, so some of the earlier exercises might break/have code duplicated elsewhere

Another Note: I have been using the online draft, so the numbering of sections, equations and exercises might not be consistent with the published version of the book. This is unfortunate, but I don't have time to correct it now.
